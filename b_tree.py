Dynamic Programming | Set 4 (Longest Common Subsequence)
We have discussed Overlapping Subproblems and Optimal Substructure properties in Set 1 and Set 2 respectively. We also discussed one example problem in Set 3. Let us discuss Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem as one more example problem that can be solved using Dynamic Programming.

LCS Problem Statement: Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, "abc", "abg", "bdf", "aeg", "acefg", .. etc are subsequences of "abcdefg". So a string of length n has 2^n different possible subsequences.




It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of diff (a file comparison program that outputs the differences between two files), and has applications in bioinformatics.

Examples:
LCS for input Sequences "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR" is "ADH" of length 3.
LCS for input Sequences "AGGTAB" and "GXTXAYB" is "GTAB" of length 4.


1) Optimal Substructure:
Let the input sequences be X[0..m-1] and Y[0..n-1] of lengths m and n respectively. And let L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) be the length of LCS of the two sequences X and Y. Following is the recursive definition of L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]).

If last characters of both sequences match (or X[m-1] == Y[n-1]) then
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = 1 + L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-2])

If last characters of both sequences do not match (or X[m-1] != Y[n-1]) then
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = MAX ( L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-1]), L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-2])

list1 = list("123abc")

def lcs(X, m, Y, n):
    if(m==0 or n == 0):
        return 0
    if(X[m-1] == Y[n-1]):
        return 1 + lcs(X, m-1, Y, n-1)
    else:
        return max(lcs(X, m-1, Y, n), lcs(X, m, Y, n-1))


print lcs(list1, len(list1), list2, len(list2))
